This repository will be used as a learning tool for me in order to learn machine learning in pyth.

I will be covering various machine-learning technicos and models from linear regression up to RNN and CNN. With most of these models I will try to make my own models from scratch and compare the output with the models from scikit learn.

I will use models on both -real and sample (made-up) data.
